Hibernate is an ORM tool.
It is used in the Data layer of applications.
It implement JPA - Java persistence API -  It is a specification or API which enables us to do ORM to a relational SQL database.
	  ORM means Object relational mapping. It means that previously we use JDBC and execute SQL queries to do fetch/CRUD in a table
	  and then take the result and map into our object by some way. But with ORM, as soon as the program starts we directly ties the
	  entities with the column of the table and didn't do many things like execute queries and then iterating and mapping.
      JPA is a way to use ORM . so it is an efficient way.
	  

**********************************************************************************	

Problem that Hibernate solves :- 

In JDBC, we generally use some code to convert the class instances to table columns and records/entitites and vice versa.  i.e we have to write some sql queries and take it and then use some code to convert it into class instances.

1) So first problem is Mapping member variables to columns.
2) Also we have problem with Mapping relationships like suppose there will be a foreign key from some table to the primary key.
	so its very difficult to take care through many lines of code.
3) Now suppose i have a boolean type. DB doesn't have boolean data type. So when storing or retrieving this data , we have to handle 
	it ourselves and write code wherever it is required.
	
So ORM is the Object Relational Mapping - The primary use is to map the objects / entities with the table fields.

So Hibernate is basically an ORM tool which deals with all these situtations. It internally uses JDBC driver.

**************************************************************************************

To start with the Hibernate Configuration , we will see the comparison between what we did for JDBC.

1) JDBC DB configuration - Hibernate Configuration through xml file
2) Modl Object - Annotations
3) Service method to create the model object - Use the hibernate API.

***************************************************************************************

So firstly we will add hibernate.cfg.xml for all the hibernate database configuration and it will give the details of the db.
Hibernate automatically takes this file as its configuration file.

@Entity - It tells hibernate that this class is an entity class and we have to do mapping of this class.
@Id - tells tht this field will be the primary key in table.

1) Create the session factory - create a session- if you want to save something we need session from sessionFactory object.
2) Create a session from session factory.
3) create a session to save model objects.

Before saving we have to begin the transaction and then after saving it we have to commit it.

As we do save if there is no table of that Class, hibernate intelligently creates the table and insert the data in it.
In later versions of hibernate it doesn't create a new table for us.


******************************************* hbm2ddl configuration ***************************************************************

If we give another record and start the program again, what hibernate will do that it will drop the existing table and create a new
one with same name and add that record. It is because of <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property> property.
This property is used to drop and recreate the schema. It is useful and not useful also.
Similarly if the property will be update, then it will just update instead of droping and creating a new table.

<property name="hibernate.show_sql">true</property> 
This above property is also usefulas it shows the SQL quries executed in the console i.e in stdout.

Now if we want the column name of the table to be somewhat different than the variable name of the class, then we have this 
@column annotation in which we can give the name property with our own assumed column name. to the memebr variable.
Similarly for the table name change , then same change the name property of the @Entity annotation. 
We can also give the @column annotation in the getters rather than the memebr variables.

For any field not to persist in table , we can just mark the memebr variable as statis or transient as static variable will always be one when
used in any classes, hence there is no meaning of it. or just give annotation @transient.

We can also give the table name using @table annotation.

@Entity(name = "someThing") => this name will be used to identify the domain ..this name will only be identified by hql queries ..ie ..name of the domain object

@Table(name = "someThing") => this name will be used to which table referred by domain object..ie ..name of the table

Similarly if we have a variable of Date type and we just want its time or date to get persisted. we can just use @Temporal annotation.

If we want a variable with huge string or data , we can give it annotation @LOB whi ch is large object.

*********************************************** Retrieve Objects using Hibernate API's ******************************************

we can retrive or fetch an object using sessionFactory.get() method. first parameter will be the object class and second will be the 
primary key.

PRIMARY KEYS 
there is a capability of creating primary keys or populating the primary key field in the table.
If there is a primary key which the user wants to populate according to him then its okay, but if we want that key on the basis of only 
primary key like it should just be unique and no business value.

So hibernate provides this annotation of @GeneratedValue and just pass the strategy. it will automatically fill the value of primary key.

************************************ Embedding Objects ***********************************************

Now let's suppose we have to embed the object into the database rather than the primitive data type. Or if our element is in the array, etc.

There are two types of object - Entity and Value object.
Entity object we know that it represents the whole object which has meaning like the USer object.
While the value object just means like it does saves the value but doesn't have any propose independently e.g the Address object in the USer object
does save the value for Address object but if there is no user object, it will not have any purpose or meaning.
Similalry the simple name memeber variable in the User object is the value object.

We also have entity inside the entity object. but yes here the Address is the Value object.

So to make a class a value Object , hibernate provides @Embeddable annotation for class and @Embedded for the memeber variable, which tells that this object needs to be embedded into another class object.. 
So If we do simple embedding of object using this annotation what hibernate will do is like , it will consider the Address object as the plain one
means all its member variable as plain member variable with User class and when we save it will make columns of all the memeber variables of the
class Address. 

If we have a object primary key , suppose the Variable member like UserName(user id, name). So if we want to embedd this then we have
@EmbeddedId as a primary key instead of giving the @Id and @Embeddable.

To configure the column name of the Embedded objects, just go to the pojo class of that object and just give the @Column annotation
and give name property to the variables.

Now suppose if we have two member variables denoting two different scenarios like in Address, we can now have Office and Home address,
So we don't want our column name similar to the simple Address class. Hence we can override the variable with @AttributesOverride property
and then provide the column name for the same.


Saving the Collections 

Now suppose instead of plain fielld table we have multiple homeaddresses for a person, so what approach will we follow :

We can think of like the Address variable should be in a list i.e set or list , and then in database the address list should be in 
a different column and there will be an id which will be the foreign key to the user id of the User table.
As a result we will save the address in another table(name class+collectionVariableName) known as JoinTable ,
 and for that we have ann annotation of @ElementCollection..

The flow is like while the hibernate sees that it's a collection it will just make a new table and just as we set the new
address tot the user it copies the user id and starts inserting the records in the table while marking the id as foreign key.


Now if i want the new table name and its primary or any columns name to be ours choice , then we use @JoinTable annotations
and if want to change the column names the inside it @JoinColumns.
